Activity : machine_id, process_id, activity_type, timestamp. 

The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.


Questions : Write SQL query to find average processing time by each machine!

  
select machine_id,
  avg(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp) as avg_time
from activity a1
left join activity a2
  on a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id and a1.process_id = a2.process_id, a1.activity_type = "end" and a2.activity_type = "start"
group by 1;
