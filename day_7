Trips : id, driver_id, city, trip_distance, start_time, end_time, rating.

Questions : Write an SQL query to find the average trip duration for each driver in each city excluding trips where the rating is below 3.
  The result should include driver_id, city, and average_trip_duration rounded to two decimal places. 

Note:
The average_trip_duration is calculated as the average of the differences between end_time and start_time for each trip.

select driver_id, trip, round(avg(timestampdiff(second(start_time, end_time)),2) as average_duration 
from trips 
where rating >= 3
group by 1, 2;
