Questions : Write a SQL query to find the top 2 restaurants in each city with the highest average rating. 
            If two restaurants have the same average rating, they should have the same rank.

select * from (select city_id, city_name, restaurant_id, restaurant_name, avg(rating) as avg_rating,
                     dense_rank() over(partition by city_id order by avg(rating) desc) as rnk
              from cities c 
              left join restaurants r
                on r.city_id = c.city_id 
              left join Orders o 
                on o.restauarnt_id = r.restauarant_id 
              group by 1, 2, 3, 4) as sub 
where rnk <= 2;
