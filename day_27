Question:
You have a table called Employees with the following columns:
id: A unique number for each employee.
name: The name of the employee.
manager_id: The id of the employee’s manager (this can be NULL if the employee has no manager).

Write a SQL query to show each employee's name along with their level in the company hierarchy. 
The level should start at 1 for employees who don’t have a manager (they are at the top of the hierarchy).


-- Expected output
id	name	level
1	Alice	1
2	Bob	2
3	Charlie	3
4	David	3
5	Eve	4
6	Frank	4
7	Grace	5

select id, name, case when manager_id is NULL then 1 else manager_id + 1 end as level
from Employees
order by 3;
