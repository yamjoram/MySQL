with cte as (select customer_id,order_date, order_amount, 
        dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date desc) as rnk 
from orders), 
cte2 as (select customer_id, order_amount as latest_order_amount from cte where rnk = 1),
cte3 as (select customer_id, order_amount as second_latest_order_amount from cte where rnk = 2)
select cte2.customer_id, cte2.latest_order_amount, cte3.second_latest_order_amount 
from cte2
left join cte3 on cte3.customer_id = cte2.customer_id;
