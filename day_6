Orders : order_id, customer_id, order_datetime, item_id, order_quantity. 
Items : item_id, item_category.

Questions 1 : How many units were ordered yesterday?
select count(*) as units_ordered 
from orders
where extract(day from order_datetime) = extract(day from current_date()) - 1;

Questions 2 : In the last 7 days (including today), how many units were ordered in each category?

select item_category, sum(order_quantity) as total_item_ordered
from items i 
left join orders o 
  on o.item_id = i.item_id 
where extract(day from order_datetime) between extract(day from current_time()) - 7 and extract(day from current_time())
group by 1;

Questions 3 : Write a query to get the earliest order_id for all customers for each date they placed an order.

select order_id from (select customer_id, order_id, order_datetime, date(order_datetime) as date, 
                             dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id, date(order_datetime) order by order_datetime) as rnk
                      from orders) as sub 
  where rnk = 1;


Questions 4 : Write a query to find the second earliest order_id for each customer for each date they placed 3 or more orders.

select order_id from (select customer_id, order_id, order_datetime, date(order_datetime) as date, 
                             dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id, date(order_datetime) order by order_datetime) as rnk
                      from orders) as sub 
  where rnk = 2;
