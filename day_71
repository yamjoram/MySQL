-- Insert sample records
INSERT INTO Transactions (id, country, state, amount, trans_date) VALUES 
(121, 'US', 'approved', 1000, '2018-12-18'),
(122, 'US', 'declined', 2000, '2018-12-19'),

Questions : Write an SQL query to find, for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, as well as the number of 
            approved transactions and their total amount. The result should be ordered by country and month.


  
select extract(month from trans_date) as month,
       country,
       count(*) as transaction_cnt,
       sum(amount) as trans_amount,
       sum(case when state = "approved" then 1 else 0 end) as approved_cnt,
       sum(case when state = "approved" then amount else 0 end) as approved_amount
from Transactions
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2;


-- Alternative --

select date_format(trans_date, "%Y-%m")as month,
       country,
       count(*) as transaction_cnt,
       sum(amount) as trans_amount,
       sum(case when state = "approved" then 1 else 0 end) as approved_cnt,
       sum(case when state = "approved" then amount else 0 end) as approved_amount
from Transactions
