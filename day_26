Orders : order_id, items

  Questions : /*
Zomato's delivery system encountered an issue where each item's order was swapped with the next item's order. 
Your task is to correct this swapping error and return the proper pairing of order IDs and items. 
If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data.
Write an SQL query to correct the swapping error and produce the corrected order pairs.
